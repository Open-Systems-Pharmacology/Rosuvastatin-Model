The PBPK model for rosuvastatin was developed and verified with clinical pharmacokinetic data.

The model was built and evaluated covering data from studies including in particular

* single intravenous administration and both single and multiple oral administrations (tablets, capsules and solution).
* a dose range of 0.002 to 80.0 mg

The model quantifies excretion via urine and bile (by glomerular filtration and active transport) and metabolism via CYP2C9. The active transport is attributed to Pgp, BCRP, OATP1B1/3, OAT3 and OATP2B1.

The next sections show:

1. the final model input parameters for the building blocks: [Section 3.1](#31-probenecid-final-input-parameters).
2. the overall goodness of fit: [Section 3.2](#32-probenecid-diagnostics-plots).
3. simulated vs. observed concentration-time profiles for the clinical studies used for model building and for model verification: [Section 3.3](#33-concentration-time-profiles).
